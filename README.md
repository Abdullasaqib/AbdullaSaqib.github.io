# ⚡ AGENTIC PORTFOLIO: CRAZY MODE

> **"Engineering Intelligence with Style."**

A high-performance, hyper-visual personal portfolio built with Next.js 16, Framer Motion, and pure cyberpunk aesthetics. This project pushes the boundaries of standard web design with interactive particle systems, physics-based springs, and holographic UI elements.
